# Credit Card Fraud Detection
---
## Project Background
I am a data scientist working for one of the biggest banks in the world. I was asked to create a project to create a machine learning to detect fraud on credit cards. I am allowed to use any algorithm as long as the result can be optimized. However, in the end I have to determine the best algorithm to use by considering its advantages and disadvantages.

## Objective
This project aims to create machine learning to detect credit card fraud.
